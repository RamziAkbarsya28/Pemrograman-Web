    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>For a moment, my mind rose from reality
        Was it heaven I touched?
        As I half forgotten
        The truth collapsed into thin air
        And I was lost in my dream again
        
        Half awake, I see your face in reality
        Was it even real?
        Glowing lights that fills the emptiness in me
        Whispering you were here
        
        And I closed my eyes
        Feeling lighter and lighter
        This emptiness is killing me
        And please hold my hands
        Hold them tighter and tighter
        Don't let them go
        Please save me from my dream
        
        Stay awake in a perfect circle
        This time I won't let myself tumbled down
        As I watched my dreams
        Splash around the corner
        Governing reality
        This time I won't forget
        
        I closed my eyes
        Feeling lighter and lighter
        Don't let me go
        Please save me from my dream</p>
